Why I chose the highest card wins game as one of my codes is because it was interesting to me and looked like a challenge and it was fun to work out the code.

Why I chose paper scissors rock as one of my codes was because it is a game that I like playing in real life and I was interested how someone made the classic game in code

Why I chose a random number generator as one of my codes is because I found super interesting how a python code can randomly print a number and it was fun to try and guess
