What is python: python is a programming language which is used for coding to make websites, games and much more.

Do I consider myself a developer yet: no I have not coded enough yet and do not really understand coding.

On  a scale from 1-5 how confident are you with each of the assignments? 3 because parts of the assignments I know what to do and parts I have no clue about.

What are you proud of up to this point in the course? Proud of how I have improved at python because I have learnt the basics of python but still have a long way to go.
