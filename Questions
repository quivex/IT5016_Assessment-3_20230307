What is python: python is a programming language which is used for coding to make websites, games and much more it is also one of the easiest 
coding programms because it will tell you when you make a misktake and what the issue is and where it is.

Do I consider myself a developer yet: no I have not coded enough yet and do not really understand coding. I feel like I will have to do some more coding
and get a better understanding of the coding first.

On  a scale from 1-5 how confident are you with each of the assignments? 3 because parts of the assignments I know what to do and parts I have 
no clue about and its also hard to know what to do when I have never done it before. But it is good to have the vidoes to watch and the staff to ask.

What are you proud of up to this point in the course? Proud of how I have improved at python because I have learnt python before and now I can actually code
a little bit now. I am also pround of learning about networks and how they work becuase I feel I have improved  quite a bit when it comes to knowing how to
set up and what is need for a network.
